This project analyzes restaurant data using machine learning and data visualization techniques.
It covers four major tasks: rating prediction, recommendation system, cuisine classification, and location-based analysis.
The dataset is preprocessed with proper handling of missing values and categorical encoding.
Regression models are used to predict restaurant ratings with strong accuracy.
A content-based recommendation system suggests restaurants based on cuisine, price range, and city.
Cuisine classification is performed using Logistic Regression and Random Forest with high F1-scores.
Geographical analysis visualizes latitude–longitude distribution and compares cities and localities.
Insightful statistics such as average ratings, price trends, and common cuisines are generated.
All tasks are fully automated through Python scripts.
The project provides clear outputs including CSV files, plots, and model files.
This repository serves as a complete ML workflow example for restaurant analytics.
